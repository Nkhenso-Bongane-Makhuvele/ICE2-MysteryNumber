Application details:

My application is a "Mystery Number Challenge" game built with React Native. When the app starts, it randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 100. I prompt the user to enter a guess through a numeric input field and let them submit it using a button. Based on their input, I provide feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct, while also keeping track of the number of guesses they've made. Once the correct number is guessed, I display a "Congratulations!" message. There is also a "Restart Game" button that allows the user to reset the game at any time, generating a new secret number and clearing all previous inputs and feedback so they can play again.

Reflection:
Although this project was originally intended to be a group assignment, I was unable to find group members due to being a full time student but currently unable to attend the classes and therefore completed it individually. Working alone presented both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, I had full responsibility for all aspects of the project, from planning and design to coding and testing. This required strong time management and problem-solving skills, as I couldn’t rely on others for input or support. On the other hand, it gave me the chance to fully engage with every part of the development process and deepen my understanding of React Native. While I missed the opportunity to collaborate and learn from peers, I’m proud of what I was able to accomplish on my own.

Applictaion Features:

The core functionality of the app is a "Mystery NumberChallenge" game designed using Visual Studio Code/React Native. When the app starts, it randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess this number using a numeric input field. Once the user enters a guess and submits it by pressing the "Submit Guess" button, the app evaluates the input and provides real-time feedback:

If the guess is too low, the app displays: "Too low! Try again."
If the guess is too high, it shows: "Too high! Try again."
If the guess is correct, the app congratulates the user with: "Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number!"

The app also includes a guess counter that tracks how many attempts the user has made, helping them stay aware of their progress. At any point, the user can press the "Restart Game" button, which resets the game by generating a new secret number, clearing the input field, resetting the feedback message, and setting the guess count back to zero. This allows the user to play multiple rounds without restarting the app.

Each feature is designed to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly, making the game engaging while also demonstrating key concepts of interactive app development.
